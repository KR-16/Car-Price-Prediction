# Car Price Prediction Flask App
This repository contains a Flask application that predicts the price of cars using random forest regression.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies.
Run the app.py script to start the Flask application.

# Dependencies
Python 3.8+
Flask

# Usage
The Flask application is hosted at localhost:5000. You can make predictions by entering the details of a car in the form.

# The features that you can enter include:

The Flask application will then use the random forest regression model to predict the price of the car.
