# Car Price Prediction Flask App
This repository contains a Flask application that predicts the price of cars using random forest regression.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies.
Run the app.py script to start the Flask application.

# Dependencies
* Python 3.8+
* Flask
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

# Usage
The Flask application is hosted at localhost:5000. You can make predictions by entering the details of a car in the form.

# The features that you can enter include:

* Year
* Showroom Price
* Kilometers Driven
* Fuel type
* Seller type
